## üìÇ Dataset  
- Source: [Multi-Labelled SMILES Odors Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryanamitbarsainyan/multi-labelled-smiles-odors-dataset)  
- Contains molecular **SMILES strings** labeled with multiple **odor categories**.  
- **Three odors selected for prediction:**  
  - **Fruity**  
  - **Woody**  
  - **Sulfurous**

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works  
1. **SMILES to Fingerprint Conversion**  
   - Uses **RDKit** to generate **1024-bit Morgan fingerprints**.  
2. **Odor Probability Prediction**  
   - A **Neural Network (PyTorch)** predicts odor probabilities.  
3. **Streamlit Web App**  
   - Allows **real-time odor prediction** from user-input SMILES.

## Example Predictions  
Here are some real examples tested with the model:  

### Example 1: `CC(C)(C)C1CCC2(CCC(=O)O2)CC1`  
- **Ground Truth:** `{Fruity: 0, Woody: 1, Sulfurous: 0}`  
- **Model Prediction:**  
  - **Fruity:** 1.72%  
  - **Woody:** 99.57%  
  - **Sulfurous:** 0.89%  
- ‚úÖ The model correctly predicts it as **WOODY**!  

---

### Example 2: `CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC`  
- **Ground Truth:** `{Fruity: 1, Woody: 0, Sulfurous: 0}`  
- **Model Prediction:**  
  - **Fruity:** 99.26%  
  - **Woody:** 1.73%  
  - **Sulfurous:** 2.47%  
- ‚úÖ The model correctly predicts it as **FRUITY**!

## About This Project  

I have built this project from scratch, handling every aspect from **data preprocessing** to **model development** and **deployment**. Initially, I experimented with **traditional machine learning algorithms** such as Random Forest and XGBoost. However, after thorough evaluation, I found that **neural networks** provided significantly better performance for odor prediction.  

To make the model accessible, I developed a **Streamlit web application** and personally **deployed it** on Streamlit Cloud. This project demonstrates my ability to work through the entire machine learning pipeline, from **data processing to model optimization and deployment**.
